# What the app does and how it works

Heard of Yelp?  Well this is a yelp for people, a rating system that goes beyond businesses and into your personal world.  Facebook is social and connects people.  Linkedin is for getting a job and for companies.  Glassdoor allows anonymous ratings on companies and bosses.

It's about time that we as humans are allowed to rate anyone and everyone.  From a family member, to a classmate, to a teammate on a sports team, to a friend, to an ex-lover, or current-lover, review a boss, or an worker, review a customer, review your doorman, or your janitor, review the person who serves you coffee, you get the idea.

It works because there is a front end using React.js and a backend using Ruby on Rails w PostGRES

## User Stories

- As a user I would like to create a profile for myself
- As a user I would like to create profiles of others
- As a user I would like to leave reviews about others

## ERD

Link to ERD:

-  a USER has one 'self-profile' and many 'other profiles'
-  a PROFILE can have many REVIEWS
-  a REVIEW belongs to a profile
-  a PROFILE belongs to a USER

## Technologies

- Ruby

| PATCH| `/users/1`  | `users#update`    |

### Setup and Install Instructions:
1.  Install dependencies with `bundle install`.
1.  `git add` and `git commit` your changes.
1.  Create a `.env` for sensitive settings (`touch .env`).
1.  Generate new `development` and `test` secrets (`bundle exec rails secret`).
1.  Store them in `.env` with keys `SECRET_KEY_BASE_<DEVELOPMENT|TEST>`
    respectively.
1.  In order to make requests to your deployed API, you will need to set
    `SECRET_KEY_BASE` in the environment of the production API (for example, using `heroku config:set` or the Heroku dashboard).
1.  In order to make requests from your deployed client application, you will
    need to set `CLIENT_ORIGIN` in the environment of the production API (for example, `heroku config:set CLIENT_ORIGIN=https://<github-username>.github.io`).
    See more about deploying to heroku [rails-heroku-setup-guide](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/rails-heroku-setup-guide)

### Setup your database:
    - bin/rails db:drop (if it already exists)
    - bin/rails db:create
    - bin/rails db:migrate
    - bin/rails db:seed
    - bin/rails db:examples

  Note: Remember to follow the same commands when setting up your deployed database!

### Run your server!
1. Run the API server with `bin/rails server` or `bundle exec rails server`.

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

-   `bin/rails routes` lists the endpoints available in your API.
-   `bin/rspec spec` runs automated tests.
-   `bin/rails console` opens a REPL that pre-loads the API.
-   `bin/rails db` opens your database client and loads the correct database.
-   `bin/rails server` starts the API.
-   `curl-scripts/*.sh` run various `curl` commands to test the API. See below.

### Reset Database without dropping

This is not a task developers should run often, but it is sometimes necessary.

**locally**

```sh
bin/rails db:migrate VERSION=0
bin/rails db:migrate db:seed db:examples
```

**heroku**

```sh
heroku run rails db:migrate VERSION=0
heroku run rails db:migrate db:seed db:examples
```
